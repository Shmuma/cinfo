The goal of this project is to provide users with more information on the
contents of the various caches of their kernel. Having more information may
be useful to:

    * determine if adding more memory is useful
    * see if the cache is functioning as it should
    * find out if your files on the server are being cached or if other
files are deemed more important

It is suspected that better awareness of caches will improve people's
ability to build and maintain high performance servers and kernels.


Supported platforms: Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, OpenBSD, Solaris
