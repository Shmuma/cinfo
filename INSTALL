Run ./configure, make and then as root, make install.

Linux
-----

You need 2.3.x for unknown x, or 2.4

FIXME: figure out x

mincore(), which we use to query the kernel, is officially only supported by
glibc 2.2, but we provide a syscall wrapper that makes it work with any
libc.

FreeBSD
-------

For compiling, you need GNU getopt. Under Linux this is integrated in libc
and therefore always available. For FreeBSD, install the 'libgnugetopt'
port.

Support confirmed for 4.3.

FIXME: which other versions work?

Mac OS X
--------

Uses both fallback getopt.c as well as getopt.h, and then works.

NetBSD
------

1.4.2 compiles and links, but the kernel doesn't support it. 1.5.1 might.

OpenBSD
-------

You need libiberty for this to work. 2.9 is confirmed, 2.6 doesn't work.
Uses a fallback getopt.h.

FIXME: which other versions work

Solaris
-------

2.8 works, uses fallback getopt.h and libiberty.
